<p>A car, or automobile, is a motor vehicle with wheels, primarily designed to run on roads, seat one to eight people, have four wheels, and mainly transport people rather than goods. The first steam-powered road vehicle was built by Joseph Cugnot in 1769, and the first internal combustion engine-powered vehicle was designed by François Isaac de Rivaz in 1808. The first practical, marketable automobile for everyday use was invented in 1886 by German inventor Carl Benz, who patented the Benz Patent-Motorwagen. Commercial cars became widely affordable with the introduction of the 1908 Model T by the Ford Motor Company, leading to their rapid adoption in the US, although global demand increased after World War II. Cars have since evolved with features like air conditioning, navigation systems, and reversing cameras. Most modern cars still use internal combustion engines running on fossil fuels, but electric cars—originally developed in the early history of automobiles—have become increasingly popular and are expected to cost as much as petrol-driven cars by 2025. The global shift to electric vehicles plays a key role in climate change mitigation efforts, including projects like Project Drawdown.</p>
